# Real-world Shadow Generation Dataset DESOBAv2 and the Official Implementation of SGDiffusion

This is the official repository for the following paper:

> Accepted by **CVPR 2024**.

**Our model has been integrated into our image composition toolbox libcom https://github.com/bcmi/libcom. Welcome to visit and try ＼(^▽^)／** 

Our model can generally achieve good results for the small objects or the objects with simple shapes. For the large objects or the objects with complex shapes, you can sample a few times and pick the most satisfactory one. 

Our improved version GPSDiffusion can be found [here](https://github.com/bcmi/GPSDiffusion-Object-Shadow-Generation).


## Dataset


**DESOBAv2** is a large-scale real-world shadow generation dataset containing object-shadow pairs like [**DESOBA**](https://github.com/bcmi/Object-Shadow-Generation-Dataset-DESOBA) dataset with 28,573 foreground objects, which is useful for supervised shadow generation methods. It has 21,575 real images with 28,573 object-shadow pairs from outdoor scenes. In the following example images, from left to right, we show the composite image, the foreground object mask, the foreground shadow mask, the background object mask, the background shadow mask, the ground-truth target image.

You can download the full DESOBAv2 Dataset from [[Baidu_Cloud]](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1_nXb3ElxImmsq2BPcBGdPQ?pwd=bcmi) (access code: bcmi) or [[One Drive]](https://1drv.ms/f/c/f4cc25a47574cccf/EmbMRAowxytJiM1KHeeeMqQBD4p1SyIShUdO2PZArkGOIA?e=sEd7ga). We release two versions: the full-resolution version and 256x256 version. 

We also release 22469 unused shadow images  [[Baidu_Cloud]](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1jfRADN2HI2YjL4L7y1JhmA) (access code: bcmi) or
 [[One Drive]](https://1drv.ms/u/c/f4cc25a47574cccf/EYyhklCnf8ZPjzTXCDvXHjQBXwwvhLHzTeaD5B0Nf8w5Jg?e=kn48Vq), in case that you want to extend DESOBAv2 dataset. 

## Our SGDiffusion
Here we provide PyTorch implementation and the trained model of our SGDiffusion.

### Installation
- Clone this repo:
    git clone https://github.com/bcmi/Object-Shadow-Generation-Dataset-DESOBAv2.git
- Download the DESOBAv2 dataset from [[Baidu Cloud]](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1_nXb3ElxImmsq2BPcBGdPQ?pwd=bcmi) (access code: bcmi) or [[One Drive]](https://1drv.ms/f/c/f4cc25a47574cccf/EmbMRAowxytJiM1KHeeeMqQBD4p1SyIShUdO2PZArkGOIA?e=sEd7ga). Unzip `desobav2-256x256.rar` to `./data/`, and rename it to `desobav2`.
- Download the checkpoints from [[Baidu Cloud]](https://pan.baidu.com/s/11tr_H9YYIM7UzwOtbHzmpQ?pwd=bcmi) (access code: bcmi) or [[One Drive]](https://1drv.ms/f/c/c718d03566122c80/EgyrW8JfnBRGguliqv-D3-8B8n5YB9mUyqQ0eKS4mzyJOA?e=ZPjAas). Unzip `ckpt.rar` to `./data/`. Note that we also provide an alternative model
`DESOBAv2_2.pth`, which can replace `DESOBAv2.pth` in `ckpt.rar`.
